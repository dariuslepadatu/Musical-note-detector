# Musical-note-detector


The project involves the implementation of a detector of musical notes. Its purpose is to process any melodious sound from an instrument, which it will transform into a note, being displayed later on the screen. This project is useful for musicians and artists who want to make sure that their songs respect certain keys and notes.
